Having a tutorial sheet as well as an assignment sheet was good for practice.","The assignment questions could have been more theory based rather than using R for every question, so that we would have more of an idea of what kind of questions would come up in the exam.","An enjoyable module, hope you have a nice Christmas break :)"

Would be great if this was the norm for all lectures.Having the tutorial questions and the assignment questions that are similar but different works very well to get a better understanding of the topics and reinforce what has been done in class.Hannah was very good at talking through the tutorial questions and answering queries - made the assignment questions much easier to complete afterwards.",None,"Great module - thanks Niamh and Hannah"

Niamh taught the module really well and kept the topics moving along at a good pace for learning. Although this is definitely a difficult subject to grasp at times i still really enjoyed it.","I think it could be useful to add one or two interactive quizzes on moodle to be completed by a student (worth no grade). I feel that due to the heavily computer based background to this module, some online questions (much like the few online in-class quizzes that were done but just left on moodule to be completed) may aid students to intuitively learn whilst also doing the general theory.","Nope. Just thanks to Niamh, everything was great and we appreciate the effort you put in to the module as a whole!!"
